# âœ… Sample Usage & Test Cases
# -------------------------------

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Creating a bank account
    account = BankAccount(100)

    # Deposit test
    account.deposit(50)
    print("Balance after deposit:", account.get_balance())  # Expected: 150

    # Withdraw test
    account.withdraw(30)
    print("Balance after withdrawal:", account.get_balance())  # Expected: 120

    # Uncomment to test assertion failures
    # account.deposit(-10)      # Should raise: Deposit amount must be positive
    # account.withdraw(200)     # Should raise: Insufficient balance
    # account2 = BankAccount(-5) # Should raise: Initial balance must be non-negative
