# Lab 4: Bisimulation Equivalence with Z3 Solver
# Z3 Solver can be used to verify equivalence. Install Z3 using Colab:
# !pip install z3-solver

from z3 import *
# Bisimulation Example: Compare two simple state transitions
x1, x2 = Ints('x1 x2')
solver = Solver()

# Define transitions
solver.add(x1 + 1 == x2 + 1) # Both states increment similarly
if solver.check() == sat:
    print("The states are bisimilar.")
else:
    print("The states are not bisimilar.")
